    <H1> The History of Craig </H1>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> I was born in Worceseter, Massachusetts at the age of 0, and I was raised in a neighboring town, Auburn, until I was 4. After that I moved to Franklin, Tennessee, just outside of Nashville. At that time I was living with my parents, my older brother, and my grandparents. After only about a year, we moved to Conway, Arkansas for a short stay, roughly six months. Then we moved back to Franklin, and from there we moved to Richlands, North Carolina, then to Clive, Iowa, staying in each place for 2 years at a time. By this time I was 11 years old, and that's when I moved to Kennebunk, only to stay for 2 years, and then move back to Franklin again, where I stayed for another 2 years, and then went back to Kennebunk. Along the way I picked up 3 new siblings and 2 step-parents. And now I'm here at the University of Maine.
