    <I> All Wired-Up </I>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> During my freshman and sophomore years in high school I worked for a family friend's company called "All Wired-Up. I didn't really have an official job title, but my job entailed installing landscape lighting, pre-wiring houses for audio equipment (like speakers in the ceiling and stuff), installing/wiring audio equipment (like speakers in the ceiling and stuff), and installing equipment for home theaters. Anything that involved playing with expensive TVs and audio/video equipment we would do for our customers. Out of all of the work that I have done in my life, which isn't really all that much, All Wired-Up is far and away the best job I've had.</p>

    <I> The Pilot House </I>
    <p> Once I moved back to Kennebunk, the summer after sophomore year, I got a job at a local restaurant/bar called "The Pilot House". I started on July 5th, during the busiest time of the year. I started out as a dishwasher, but after 5 long months I was finally out of the dish pit and into the kitchen as a line cook. I stayed there for 2 more summers before I had to leave to go to college. In my time there I was introduced to some of the most peculiar and interesting people that I have ever met.</p>

    <I> University of New England </I>
    <p> For a brief period in between my job at the Pilot House and my acceptance into the University of Maine, I had a job in Information Technology at the University of New England. My duties there were to follow around the lead AV Technician and try to absorb as much information as I could. I learned more about technology at UNE than I had collectively in my life until that point. </p>
