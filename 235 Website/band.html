    <p style="text-align:center;"> This is my high school band, Dads Night Out. From right to left we have our keyboard player, Isaac, guitar guy, me, bassist, Dakota, drummer/backup singer, Riley, and other guitar guy/lead singer, Casey. We started off by playing at school assemblies, but realized that we could probably make some money by playing at local restaurants and lawn parties. So that's what we did. Over the summer we played gigs all over town, and even were invited to play at Casey's uncle's wedding all the way down in Massachusetts. As for how we got the name, I'm still not quite sure. </p>
